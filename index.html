        <p>Hello, my name is Chau Lin Lam. You can call me Cathy, that is OK. I live in London with my older sister and her family. I have been here for half year. I am from Hong Kong and I was lived in Hong Kong with my parents. Also, I have another older sister live in Hong Kong too. I was a Graphic Designer in Japanese band company when I worked in Hong Kong. I love graphic design, so I love my job.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I really love watching Japan animations and reading comics. I want to learn more about Japanese cultures, so I had studied Japanese 6 years ago, and passed the Japanese-Language Proficiency test level N3. Furthermore, I love drawing. I always use a digital pad to draw illustration when I free. My another hobbies is travelling to the world. I have traveled over 15 countries already, such as Germany and France.</p>
